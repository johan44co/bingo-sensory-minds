# Bingo Sensory Minds

It has been a amazing time while developing this code challenge. I decide to add Multiplayer features, people connected from differents devices can play together. Users can choose their own username by pressing click on the default username. They also can see in real time who was the last bingo and exactly how long time ago it was. I did add animations for every way of winning (1 row, double bingo, triple bingo and full bingo). Every time the board is reset you get a new board with the phrases reorganized.

I did use React, Redux and Socket.IO to develope the challenge.
